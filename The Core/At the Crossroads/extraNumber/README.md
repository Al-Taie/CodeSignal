**You're given three integers, `a, b` and `c`. It is guaranteed that two of these integers are equal to each other. What is the value of the third integer?**
### Example

For:

```
a = 2, b = 7, and c = 2
```

the output should be:

```
extraNumber(a, b, c) = 7
```
The two equal numbers are `a` and `c`. The third number `(b)` equals `7`, which is the answer.
