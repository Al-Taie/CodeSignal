**Given integers `a` and `b`, determine whether the following pseudocode results in an infinite loop**
```
while a is not equal to b do
increase a by 1
decrease b by 1
```
**Assume that the program is executed on a virtual machine which can store arbitrary long numbers and execute forever.**

### Example

For:

```
[1] a = 2 and b = 6
[2] For a = 2 and b = 3
```

the output should be:

```
[1] isInfiniteProcess(a, b) = false
[2] isInfiniteProcess(a, b) = true
```
