**Given a divisor and a bound, find the largest integer `N` such that:**

**`N` is divisible by divisor.**
**`N` is less than or equal to bound.**
**`N` is greater than `0`.**
**It is guaranteed that such a number exists.**

### Example

For:

```
divisor = 3 and bound = 10
```

the output should be:

```
maxMultiple(divisor, bound) = 9
```
The largest integer divisible by `3` and not larger than `10` is `9`
