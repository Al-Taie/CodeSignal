**Given integers n, l and r, find the number of ways to represent n as a sum of two integers A and B such that l ≤ A ≤ B
≤ r.**

### Example

For:

```
n = 6, l = 2, and r = 4
```

the output should be:

```
countSumOfTwoRepresentations2(n, l, r) = 2.

There are just two ways to write 6 as A + B, where 2 ≤ A ≤ B ≤ 4: 6 = 2 + 4 and 6 = 3 + 3.
