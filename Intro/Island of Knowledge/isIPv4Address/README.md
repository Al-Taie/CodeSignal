**An IP address is a numerical label assigned to each device (e.g., computer, printer) participating in a computer
network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. There are two versions of the Internet protocol, and thus two
versions of addresses. One of them is the IPv4 address.

Given a string, find out if it satisfies the IPv4 address naming rules.**

### Example

For:

```
inputString = "172.16.254.1"
inputString = "172.316.254.1"
inputString = ".254.255.0"
```

the output should be:

```
isIPv4Address(inputString) = true
isIPv4Address(inputString) = false
-> 316 is not in range [0, 255]

isIPv4Address(inputString) = false
-> There is no first number.
```
