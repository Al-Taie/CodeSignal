**Given a year, return the century it is in. The first century spans from the year 1 up to and including the year 100,
the second - from the year 101 up to and including the year 200, etc.**

### Example

For:

```
[1] year = 1905
[2] year = 1700
```

the output should be:

```
[1] centuryFromYear(year) = 20
[2] centuryFromYear(year) = 17
```
